## Technical Achievements
1. I styled the page using a separate CSS file, "test.css". In it I adjusted the color, font-size, position, and text-align of the words on the page, and the height, width, and position of the image that I placed on the page.
   I also adjusted the specifics of the Google Font I chose, such as font-weight and font-style.
2. I also added an animation for the image for it to move from off screen, onto the screen.
3. Other semantic HTML tags that were used were 'header', where I placed the title of the page, 'img', which was just an image of lacrosse sticks, 'table', for the information about my classes, and 'footer', in which I placed 'a', a hyperlink to surprise the user.

## Design Achievements
1. I created a color palette using color.adobe.com, which can be seen in "colorwheel.png", and used all the colors to change different texts colors and
   the background
2. I used the Roboto Serif font from Google Fonts for the text on my page.

## Difficulties

I wasn't able to figure out how to correctly fix formatting when in a smaller window, so if the page isn't fullscreen, the image will probably cross into the text, but will still be behind it.
